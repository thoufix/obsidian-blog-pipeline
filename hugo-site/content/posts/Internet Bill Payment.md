## 💳 ICICI Credit Card Billing Cycle

- **How to View Current Cycle:**

- **Current Cycle End Date:** 16th August 2025
- **Option to Change Billing Cycle:** ✅ Yes

📌 Since ACT bills are generated on the **1st** and due by **15th**, having a billing cycle that ends **after the 1st** (like the current 16th) is ideal.

✅ No need to change billing cycle unless more alignment is desired.
