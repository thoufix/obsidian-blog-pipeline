Animal eats paper  
and says it has become tree.

Tree makes paper  
and calls it memory.

Animal eats memory  
and grows heavy with it.

Man eats animal  
and says he has become more.

He exhales.

The tree takes him back  
without asking.

Tree makes paper.  
Animal eats paper.  
Man eats animal.

Nothing becomes anything.  
It only passes through  
wearing a different name.
