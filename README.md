# Obsidian-to-Blog: CI/CD Blog Pipeline with Hugo + GitHub + Raspberry Pi

This project sets up an automated CI/CD pipeline for a personal blog using **Obsidian**, **Hugo**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Raspberry Pi**. The idea is to write blog posts in **Obsidian** (Markdown), sync them to GitHub, and deploy the static site to a Raspberry Pi (self-hosted) using **Hugo** for static site generation and **GitHub Actions** for continuous deployment.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

### What You'll Build:
- **Write**: Blog posts in **Obsidian** using Markdown.
- **Sync**: Automatically sync posts to **GitHub**.
- **CI/CD**: Use **GitHub Actions** to:
  - Build the site with **Hugo**.
  - Deploy the static site to your **Raspberry Pi** via **SSH**.
- **Host**: Serve the site on your Pi using **Caddy** or **Nginx** (or via Docker).
  
This project mirrors real-world DevOps workflows like:
- Source control and versioning with Git.
- CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.
- Static site generation with Hugo.
- Self-hosting and deploying to a Raspberry Pi.
- Backup and version control through Git.

### Tools Used:
- **Obsidian**: Local Markdown writing for blog posts.
- **Hugo**: Static site generator for building the blog.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automation of building and deploying.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Self-hosting the site.
- **Caddy** or **Nginx**: For serving the static site.
- **SSH**: For secure file transfer to the Raspberry Pi.
